      "Adrenoleukodystrophy ( ALD ) is a genetically determined disorder associated with progressive central demyelination and adrenal cortical insufficiency . All affected persons show increased levels of saturated unbranched very-long-chain fatty acids , particularly hexacosanoate ( C26  0 ) , because of impaired capacity to degrade these acids . This degradation normally takes place in a subcellular organelle called the peroxisome , and ALD , together with Zellwegers cerebrohepatorenal syndrome , is now considered to belong to the newly formed category of peroxisomal disorders . Biochemical assays permit prenatal diagnosis , as well as identification of most heterozygotes . We have identified 303 patients with ALD in 217 kindreds . These patients show a wide phenotypic variation . Sixty percent of patients had childhood ALD and 17 % adrenomyeloneuropathy , both of which are X-linked , with the gene mapped to Xq28 . Neonatal ALD , a distinct entity with autosomal recessive inheritance and points of resemblance to Zellwegers syndrome , accounted for 7 % of the cases . Although excess C26  0 in the brain of patients with ALD is partially of dietary origin , dietary C26  0 restriction did not produce clear benefit . Bone marrow transplant lowered the plasma C26  0 level but failed to arrest neurological progression . .\n"
